    <h1> Amraz Hussain </h1>
      <p>Amraz Hussain, (B.1997) is a creative visual artist, who is inspired by his surroundings and takes in current trends to then express it throughout his artwork. His theme of artwork is always changing as he likes to endower onto different projects but always portrays his work in a contemporary setting.</p>

<p>Skateboarding over the years has turned into a culture. The skateboard culture is built around and supports creative individuals. Art has a big influence on the skate scene, whether that is the artistic board designs or designing parks. It has led individuals to exploring more with their skateboard.</p>

<p>The artwork I will be exhibiting will be a series of skateboard images but with the design of the board designed by code using processing.js and by using generative tools to create a 3d loop to create a skating motion.</p>
