    <h1> Dean Samuel </h1>
      <p>Dean Samuel, a young developing artist with a general interest towards the visual components of games, movies and other image based entertainment. The majority of my past art work was produced while studying A-level art in sixth form, along with ICT and Business and Economics.</p>

<p>Between finishing sixth form and starting university, I practiced creating digital drawings in Photoshop using a graphics tablet. These drawings were often of objects I was interested in, or people in the entertainment industry I am interested in.</p>

<p>To take my interests further my work has been based around games design. The program is filled with ‘assets’, such as mountains and trees which will be selected at random to create game like landscapes. Each landscape should be immersive, yet filled with glitches.</p>
